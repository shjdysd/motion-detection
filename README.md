# Motion Detection
The target of our project is to implement a traffic condition estimating system which is able to detect the movements of vehicles in road and to estimate the road conditions by analyzing videos/stream from monitoring cameras.
Our system consists of three parts: Video/Stream Processingï¼ŒVehicles Detection and Road Condition Estimation. Object detection plays a key role in image recognition system and can be applied in different application, ranging from monitoring to advance tracking. In our project, we are going to use optical flow to detect moving object. We then estimate the traffic condition based on detected data like the number of vehicles in screen at the same time, average moving speed of vehicles comparing to the speed limits of the road, etc.
